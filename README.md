#Star Wars Trivia Game

This project is the second Java Script assigment in the UofT Coding Bootcamp.

## What it does

This project reads an array of objects with trivia questions, alternatives and the correct answer, then build the screens that will display the questions and alternatives to the user using JavaScript. 

When the user selects a answer, the project will provide the feedback and the correct answer in case of a wrong selection, and also count the number of correct and wrong choices.

If the user does not select an answer during the predefined time, it will count towards a wrong answer and the user will receive the feedback with the correct anwser.

When the user answer all questions, the app will restart and the user can try again.
